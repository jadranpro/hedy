                    ## Make a story
                    In level 1 you can make a story with a different main character that you enter yourself.

                    As the first line, use this code:

                    `ask who is the protagonist of your story`

                    After that first line, start with `print` if the sentence needs to be printed.
                    You use `echo` if you want your main character to be at the end of the sentence.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    ask The main character of this story is ...
                    print The main character is now going to walk in the forest
                    echo He's a bit scared who ...
                    print He hears crazy noises everywhere
                    print He's afraid this is a haunted forest
                    ```

                    ## What's next?
                    It is a pity that you can now only make sentences in which the main character is at the end of the sentence right? After practicing with this story, continue to level 2 and then to level 3, where you can make more and more complicated programs.

                start_code: "print Your story starts here"
            2:
                story_text: |
                    ## Story in level 2
                    In level 2 you can make your story more fun. Your main character's name can now be anywhere in the sentence.

                    You do have to program a little bit extra for that. You must now name your main character first.

                    You can then put that name anywhere in a sentence.

                    ## Example Hedy code

                    ```
                    name is ask What is the name of the main character?
                    print name is now going to run in the woods
                    print name is a bit scared
                    print He hears crazy noises everywhere
                    print name is afraid this is a haunted forest
                    ```

                    ## Randomness
                    You can also add something random to your story. Any monster, animal or other obstacle.

                    It goes like this:
                    ```
                    animals is owl, hedgehog, armadillo
                    print He now hears the sound of an animal at random
                    ```

                    ## What's next?
                    Did you happen to try to make a sentence that contained the word name?
                    E.g. `print my name is name`. Give it a try if you haven't already.

                    That does not work properly, it will print my Henk is Henk. You can solve that in level 3.
                start_code: "print Your story"
            3:
                story_text: |
                    ## Story in level 3
                    You may have noticed that there is still a mistake in level 2.

                    Did you happen to try to make a sentence that contained the word name? E.g. `print my name is name`.

                    That didn't work well! Then you get: my Henk is Henk. You can solve that in level 3.

                    You must use quotation marks for everything that you are going to print.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    name is Hans
                    print 'The name of the main character is' name
                    print name 'is now going to walk in the woods'
                    print name 'is a bit scared'
                    animals is owl, hedgehog, armadillo
                    print 'He hears the sound of an' animals at random
                    print name 'is afraid this is a haunted forest'
                    ```
                start_code: "print Your story will be printed here!"
            4:

                    ## Story in level 4
                    What you can do in level 4 is make your story even more fun. In level 4 you can program different endings.

                    Think of two endings for your story, for example:

                    - The princess is walking through the forest
                    - She runs into a monster

                    - Happy ending: She takes her sword and the monster quickly runs away
                    - Bad Ending: The monster eats the princess

                    You can also ensure that a name can be entered again. That works just like in level 3. You can combine that with an `if`, and then you have already made a whole program!

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    name is ask Who is walking in the forest?
                    print name 'walks through the forest'
                    print name 'encounter a monster'
                    end is ask Would you like a good or a bad ending?
                    if the end is good print name 'takes the sword and the monster quickly runs away' else print 'The monster eats' name
                    ```
                start_code: "print Here will soon be your story!"
            5:
                story_text: |
                    ## Story in level 5
                    In a story, someone says words several times. For example, when someone calls for help or sings a song.
                    You can put such repetitions in your story, in level 5 with 'repeat'.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    print 'The prince kept calling for help'
                    repeat 5 times print 'Help!'
                    print 'Why isn't anyone helping me?'
                    ```

                start_code: "repeat 5 times print 'Help!'"
    songs:
        name: "Sing a song!"
        description: "Print a song"
        image: "songs.png"
        default_save_name: "Song"
        levels:
            5:
                story_text: |
                    ## Songs in level 5
                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. For example... Baby Shark! If you sing it, you keep singing the same thing:

                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark

                    You can make this song much shorter with a `repeat`! Can you finish the code?

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    repeat ... ... print 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'
                    print 'Baby Shark'
                    ```

                    After Baby Shark you can of course also program other songs. There are many songs with repetition.
                start_code: "print 'Baby Shark'"
            6:
                story_text: |
                    ## Songs in level 6
                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. Sometimes the repetition is also based on counting.
                    For example, in the well-known song 'Bottles of beer'. You can program that song with a little math.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    verse is 99
                    print verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    print verse ' bottles of beer'
                    print 'Take one down, pass it around'
                    verse is verse - 1
                    print verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    ```

                    You can now repeat lines 2 to 9 as many times as you want by copying the lines.

                    # Looking ahead
                    In level 5 we learned to repeat 1 line with `repeat`, like this:

                    * repeat 3 times print 'Baby Shark Tutududududu'

                    But as you will see in this lesson, sometimes you want to repeat several lines together. This can be done with cutting and pasting, but that is a lot of work. In level 7 you will learn how to do that more easily.
                start_code: "print 'Baby shark'"
            7:
                story_text: |
                    ## Songs in level 7
                    In level 6 you've programmed the song 'Bottles of beer'. You made one verse and then had to copy the verses 99 times. In level 7 you can repeat the song 99 times, just by adding one simple line!

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    verse is 99
                    repeat 99 times
                        print verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                        print verse ' bottles of beer'
                        print 'Take one down, pass it around'
                        verse is verse - 1
                        print verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    ```

                    ## Dishwashing program in level 2
                    Do you always disagree at home about who should wash the dishes or change the litter box today?

                    Then you can let the computer choose very fairly. You can program that in level 2!

                    You first make a list of the members of your family. Then choose 'at random' from the list.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    people is mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    print people at random
                    ```

                    ## What's next?
                    Did you happen to try to make a sentence that contained the word people?

                    E.g. `print I chose from these people`. Give it a try if you haven't already.

                    That is not working properly! Then you get: I chose from these [mom, dad, Emma, Sophie]. You can solve that in level 3.

                start_code: "print Who does the dishes?"
            3:
                story_text: |
                    ## Dishwashing program in level 3
                    With quotation marks you can make your dishwashing planning more beautiful.
                    This time the sample code is not quite complete.

                    Can you complete the code by entering the correct commands or characters on the dots?
                    Every three dots must be replaced with one command.

                    Tip: Don't forget the quotation marks!
                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    people is mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    print ... the dishes are done by ...
                    print people at ...
                    ```
                start_code: "print 'Who does the dishes?'"

                story_text: |
                    ## Dishwashing program in level 4
                    With the `if` you can now have more fun with choice in the program. You can have your program respond to the choice that the computer has made.

                    Can you finish the code so that it prints 'too bad' when it is your turn and otherwise 'yes!'?
                    Don't forget the quotes!

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    people is mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    dishwasher is people at random
                    if dishwasher is Sophie print ... too bad I have to do the dishes ... else print 'luckily no dishes because' ... 'is already washing up'
                    ```
                start_code: "print 'Who does the dishes?'"

                story_text: |
                    ## Dishwashing program in level 5
                    With the `repeat` you can repeat pieces of code. You can use this to calculate who will be washing dishes for the entire week.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    people is mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    repeat ... ... print 'the dishwasher is' ...
                    ```
                start_code: "print 'Who does the dishes?'"
            6:
                story_text: |
                    ## Dishwashing program in level 6
                    How often is everyone going to do the dishes? Is that fair? You can count that in level 6.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    people is mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    emma_washes is 0
                    dishwasher is people at random
                    print 'The dishwasher is' dishwasher
                    if dishwasher is Emma emma_washes is emma_washes + 1
                    print 'Emma will do the dishes this week' emma_washes 'times'
                    ```

                    Now you can copy lines 3 to 5 a few times (e.g. 7 times for a whole week) to calculate for a whole week again.
                    Do you make the code for the whole week?

                    ## What's next?
                    Now you have to copy and paste a lot, right? We will fix that in level 7.
                    This level is the end of the washing up adventure! But there are still many adventures to be made in other levels, such as a calculator, an interactive story and a more complicated game.

                    In level 2 we can choose from a list. With that we can let the computer choose one side of the die.

                    Take a look at the games you have in your closet at home.

                    Are there games with a (special) die? You can also copy it with this code.

                    For example, the dice of the game Earthworms with the numbers 1 to 5 and an earthworm on it.

                    ## What's next?
                    Did you happen to try to make a sentence that included the word choices?

                    E.g. `print I chose from the choices`. Give it a try if you haven't already.

                    That is not working properly! Then you get: I chose from the [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm]. You can solve that in level 3.

                    ## Dice in level 4
                    You can also make a die again in level 4 using the `if`.
                    Complete the sample code so that the code says "You can stop throwing" once you have thrown an earthworm.

                    But maybe you want to recreate a die from a completely different game. That's fine too! Then make up your own reaction. Eg 'yes' for 6 and 'pity' for something else.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    choices is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                    throw is ...
                    print 'you have' ... 'thrown'
                    if ... is earthworm print 'You can stop throwing.' ... print 'You have to hear it again!'

                    ## Dice in level 5
                    You can also make a die again in level 5. With the `repeat` code you can easily roll a whole hand of dice.
                    Try to finish the sample code! The dashes should contain multiple commands and characters.

                    But maybe you want to make a completely different die. Of course you can!

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    choices is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm

                    ## Dice in level 6
                    You can also make an earthworm die again in level 6, but now you can also calculate how many points have been rolled.

                    You may know that the worm counts 5 points for Earthworms. Now after a roll you can immediately calculate how many points you have thrown.

                    This is the code to calculate points for one die:

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    choices is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                    points is 0
                    throw is choices at random
                    print 'you threw' throw
                    if throw is earthworm points is points + 5 else points is points + throw
                    print 'those are' points
                    ```
                    Can you make the code so that you get the total score for 8 dice? To do that, you have to cut and paste some lines of the code.

                    ## Looking forward

                    Did you manage to calculate the score for 8 dice? That required a lot of cutting and pasting, right? We are going to make that easier in level 7!

                    ## Rock, paper, scissors
                    In level 1 you can start with a rock, paper, scissors  game.

                    With `ask` you can make a choice, and with `echo` you can repeat that choice.

                    ## Example Hedy code

                    ```
                    print what do you choose?
                    ask choose from rock, paper or scissors
                    echo so your choice was:
                    ```

                    ## What's next?
                    Just repeating is of course a bit boring because the computer does not choose anything. We will make that ourselves later.

                    ## Rock, paper, scissors

                    In level 2 we can enter lists and choose things from them.

                    You first make a list with `is`. Then you can let the computer choose something from the list with `at random`.

                    For example, you can let the computer pick from rock, paper and scissors.

                    ## Example Hedy code

                    ```
                    choices is rock, paper, scissors
                    print choices at random
                    ```

                    You can use the `ask` again in level 2. Can you print your choice and the choice from the computer?
                    Beware though, `ask` now works differently than in level 1. There must be a name in front of it.

                    ## Looking forward
                    Did you happen to try to make a sentence that included the word choices?

                    E.g. `print I chose from the choices`. Give it a try if you haven't already.

                    That is not working properly! Then you get: I chose from the [rock, paper, scissors]. You can solve that in level 3.

                    In level 3 we can further program rock, paper, scissors. But if you want to add text, you have to use quotation marks here too.
                    Do you complete the code by entering the correct commands or characters on the dots?

                    ## Example Hedy code

                    ## Rock, paper, scissors in level 4
                    In level 4 we can determine who won.
                    For that you need the new `if` code.

                    Save your choice with the name of choice and the choice of computer as computer choice.
                    Then you can use `if` to see if they are the same or different.
                    Will you finish the code?

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    options is rock, paper, scissors
                    computer choice is ...
                    choice is ask What do you choose?
                    print 'you chose' ...
                    print 'computer chose' ...
                    if ... is ... print 'tie!' else print 'no tie'
                    if choice is stone and computer choice is paper print 'computer wins'
                    ```

                    First fill in the correct code on the dots to see if it is a draw.

                    Then copy the last line a few times and fill in all the different options correctly.

                    Now you have finished your own rock, paper, scissors! It's still a bit complicated with all those different options, isn't it?
                    We will make that a bit easier in a later level.

                    ## Calculator
                    Now that you can calculate, you can also create a program to practice maths calculations. You can make up the calculations yourself, for example:

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    correct_answer is 11 * 27
                    print 'How much is 11 times 27?'

                    if answer is correct_answer print 'good job!' else print 'Wrong! It was ' correct_answer

                    ## Random numbers
                    You can also let the computer do random sums on its own using random.

                    This is how you choose a number of tables to practice, and from that you always get a different sum:

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    tables is 4, 5, 6, 8

                    correct_answer is table * number
                    print 'how much is ' table ' times ' number '?'
                    answer is ask Do you know the answer?

                   Simply add lists of your favorite (or least favorite) meals and Hedy can randomly choose your dinner.
                   You can also have a bit of fun, by letting Hedy choose the price for your dinner as well! What will you get?

                       Be careful! In level 2 apostrophes were allowed in the text, but in level 3 Hedy will confuse them for quotation marks and the code will not work!
                       So instead of typing  `print Today we're serving pizza` , you should type `print 'Today we are serving pizza'`

                       if anything is no print 'Thats it!' else print 'One ' anything
                       print 'Thank you for your order and enjoy your meal!'
                       ```

                       ## Challenge
                       Can you think of more questions to ask the customers when they are ordering, and make up different responses to their answers by using the if command?

                    In level 5 you've learned how to use the repeat command to repeat a line of code a certain amount of times.
                    You can use that in your restaurant to ask multiple people what they'd like to eat. Like this:

                    ```
                    print 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant!'
                    people is ask 'How many people are joining us today?'
                    repeat people times food is ask 'What whould you like to eat?'
                    print 'Thanks for your order! Its coming right up!'
                    ```
                    In level 5 you can ask multiple people what they'd like to eat, but you can't print each order individually, because you can only repeat one line of code.
                    In level 7 you'll learn how to repeat multiple lines of code at once, which allows you to ask multiple orders and print them too!

                      ## Restaurant
                      In level 6 you can use maths to calculate the total price of your customer's order, which can make your virtual restaurant more realistic.

                      ## Example Hedy Code (Simple)
                      You can make a simple restaurant code, like this:
                      ```
                      print 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant'
                      print 'Here is our menu:'
                      print 'Our main courses are pizza, lasagne, or spaghetti'
                      main is ask Which main course would you like?
                      price is 0
                      if main is pizza price is 10
                      if main is lasagne price is 12
                      if main is spaghetti price is 8
                      print 'You have ordered ' main
                      print 'That will be ' price ' dollars, please'
                      print 'Thank you, enjoy your meal!'
                      ```
                      But you can also add many more things to your virtual restaurant, for example more courses.

                      ## Example Hedy Code (Elaborate)
                      In this example there are three courses, which requires more code and more additions in calculating the price.
                      ```
                      print 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant'
                      print 'Here is our menu:'
                      print 'Our starters are salad, soup, or carpaccio'
                      print 'Our main courses are pizza, lasagne, or spaghetti'
                      print 'Our desserts are brownie, icecream, or milkshake'
                      starter is ask Which starter would you like to have?
                      main is ask Which main course would you like?
                      dessert is ask Which dessert do you pick?
                      price is 0
                      if starter is soup price is price + 6 else price is price + 7
                      if main is pizza price is price + 10
                      if main is lasagne price is price + 12
                      if main is spaghetti price is price + 8
                      if dessert is brownie price is price + 7
                      if dessert is icecream price is price + 5
                      if dessert is milkshake price is price + 4
                      print 'You have ordered ' starter ' , ' main ' and ' dessert
                      print 'That will be ' price ' dollars, please'
                      print 'Thank you, enjoy your meal!'
                      ```
                      ## Challenge
                      You can add many more things to your virtual restaurant. For example, can you...
                      ... ask how many people are coming and multiply the price by that amount?
                      ... add another course?
                      ... give people a discount when they enter a (secret) couponcode?
                      ... add a children's menu?
                      ... think of other fun things to add?

                    repeat people times
                        food is ask What whould you like to order?
                        print food
                        if food is pizza
                            price is price + 10
                        else
                            price is price + 8
                    print 'Thank you for ordering!'
                    print 'That will be ' price 'dollar'
                    print 'Enjoy your meal!'
                    ```

                    ## Challenge
                    Of course, this code can be expanded with more items on the menu, offering drinks, and/or multiple courses, so feel free to add as many options as you like!

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    Have you ever been to a carnival and had your future predicted by a fortune teller? Or have you ever played with a magic eight ball?
                    Then you probably know that they can't really predict your future, but it's still fun to play!

                    In the upcoming levels you can learn how to create your own fortune telling machine!
                    In level 1 you can start off easy by letting Hedy introduce herself as a fortune teller and let her echo the players' answers.
                    Like this:

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    print Hello, I'm Hedy the fortune teller!
                    ask Who are you?
                    print Let me take a look in my crystall ball
                    print I see... I see...
                    echo Your name is...
                    ```

                    ## Challenge
                    Hedy now only tells you your name. Can you expand the code so that Hedy can predict more things about you?

                    Obviously, Hedy isn't a very good fortune teller yet, as she can only repeat the answers that were given by the players!
                    Take a look in level 2 to improve your fortune teller.

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    In level 1 you've created your first fortune telling machine, but Hedy couldn't really predict anything, only echo.
                    In level 2 you can use a variable and the `at random` command to really let Hedy choose an answer for you. Check out this code for instance:

                    ## Example Hedy Code
                    In this example the player can ask Hedy a yes-no question and Hedy will pick a random answer for you.
                    ```
                    print I’m Hedy the fortune teller!
                    question is ask What do you want to know?
                    print This is what you want to know: question
                    answers is yes, no, maybe
                    print My crystal ball says... answers at random
                    ```

                    ## Challenges
                    Now, Hedy can only answer yes, no or maybe. Can you give Hedy more answer options, like 'definitely' or 'ask again'.

                    Level 3 has no new functions, but allows you to practice with using the quotation marks.
                    You can remake your level 2 code, and make sure to add the quotation marks in the right places!

                    Mind that in level 2, we couldn't use the word 'question' as both the name of the variable and a normal word that could be printed.
                    The quotation marks in level 3 make this possible!

                    Important! Mind that now that we're using quotation marks, Hedy will get confused when you use the apostrophe for contractions like I'm or What's.
                    Make sure to remove those apostophes and change the spelling to Im or Whats.

                    ## Example Hedy Code
                    ```
                    print 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    question is ask What do you want to know?
                    print 'This is your question: ' question
                    answers is yes, no, maybe

                    In Level 4 you'll learn to (secretly) tip the odds in your favor, when using the fortune teller!
                    By using `if` and `else` you can make sure that you will always get a good fotune, while other people might not.
                    Check out this example to find out how.

                    ## Example Hedy Code
                    ```
                    print 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    print 'I can predict if youll win the lottery tomorrow!'
                    person is ask Who are you?
                    if person is Hedy print 'You will definitely win!' else print 'Bad luck! Someone else will win!'
                    ```

                    Replace Hedy with your own name in the last line, and Hedy will always predict that you will win the lottery and others won't!
                    Of course this might raise some suspicion with the other players... To avoid that, you can make sure that Hedy does give different answers everytime you run the code.
                    But of course, still gives you a positive answer and the other players a negative one.

                    ## Example Hedy Code 2
                    ```
                    print 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    print 'I can predict if youll win the lottery tomorrow!'
                    person is ask Who are you?
                    goodanswer is Hurray! You win!, You will definitely win!, We have a winner!
                    badanswer is Bad luck! Try again!, Someone else will win, You lose!
                    if person is Hedy print goodanswer at random else print badanswer at random
                    ```

                    ## Challenges
                    This concept can be used to make may different programs, just be creative! For example you could create a machine that predicts that your favorite sports team will beat all the competitors!
                    Or you could make  Snow White's magic mirror on the wall, to tell everyone you are the fairest of them all!

                   In level 5 you can use the repeat command to make your machine tell multiple fortunes at once.

                   ## Example Hedy Code
                   ```
                   print 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
                   print 'You can ask 3 questions!'
                   repeat 3 times question is ask What do you want to know?
                   answer is yes, no, maybe
                   repeat 3 times print 'My crystall ball says... ' answer at random
                   ```

                   ## Challenge
                   As you can see, the questions aren't printed in this example. That's because the variable `question` was changed 3 times.
                   Everytime the player fills in the new answer, Hedy overwrites the previous one, so the first answer the player gave is forgotten.
                   This means you can't print all the questions this way.

                   By using 3 different variables instead of 1 (for example `question1` , `question2` and `question3`), you could solve the problem and print the questions.
                   This does mean that you can only use `repeat` for the answers, and you will have to ask and print all the questions seperately.
                   Can you do it?

                   In level 7 the layout of repeat command will change, which enables you to repeat multiple lines at once.

                   In level 6 you can use maths in your predictions as a fortune teller. This allows you to make up (silly) formulas to calculate the future.
                   For example you could calculate how rich you'll get or how many kids you will have when you grow up.

                   siblings is How many siblings do you have?
                   length is How tall are you in centimetres?
                   kids is length / age

                   bananas is ask How many bananas did you eat this week?
                   hygiene is ask How many times did you wash your hands today?
                   result is bananas + hygiene

                 In level 7 that problem is solved, because of the new way of using the repeat command.

                    If you pick the right door you'll survive, but if not a terrible monster might...

                    In level 1 we start our haunted house game by making up a scary story and ask the player what monster they'll see in the haunted house.

                    ## Haunted house game
                    In level 1 you've made an introduction to your haunted house game, but as you might have noticed the story would always have a dreadful end.
                    In level 2 you can make your story more interactive by changing the outcome of the game; sometimes you'll get eaten, sometimes you'll escape!
                    Let Hedy decide randomly!

                    ## Example Hedy Code
                    ```
                    print Escape from the haunted house!
                    print There are 3 doors in front of you...
                    choice is ask Which door do you choose?
                    print You picked door ... choice
                    monsters is a zombie, a vampire, NOTHING YOUVE ESCAPED
                    print You see...
                    print monsters at random
                    ```

                    ## Challenge
                    This story is pretty straight forward, maybe you can spook it up a bit by adding a more exciting story.
                    Also you have very limited outcomes right now, there are only 3 options of what's behind the doors. Maybe you can think of more monsters to add to the list!

                    ## Change the game into a tv gameshow!
                    Lastly, we'd like to challenge you to change this game into a gameshow (like the ones on tv) where you choose a door or suitcase and it contains a big price!
                    Can you do it?

                    ## Haunted House
                    Up until this level the haunted house game always asked the player to choose a door, but as you might have noticed, they didn't really have to answer correctly.
                    In the player filled in a completely random answer, the game would still work and the player might even win (despite not picking a door).
                    In level 4 you can pnly win the game by picking the same door Hedy picked randomly.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    print 'Escape from the haunted house!'
                    print 'There are 3 doors in front of you...'
                    doors is 1,2,3
                    monsters is werewold, mummy, vampire, zombie
                    chosendoor is ask Which door do you choose?
                    print 'You chose door...' chosendoor
                    correctdoor is doors at random
                    if chosendoor is correctdoor print 'Great! Youve escaped!' else print 'Oh no! You are being eaten by a...' monsters at random
                    ```
